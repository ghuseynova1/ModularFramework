# ModularFramework
 Building Test Automation Framework using Selenium and TestNG

# Project Overview
Selenium is one of the most widely used functional UI automation testing tools and TestNG is a brilliant testing framework.

Test automation frameworks are a set of guidelines or rules to writing test cases. They can reduce maintenance costs and testing efforts and will provide a higher return on investment (ROI) for teams looking to optimize their processes. Testing guidelines include coding standards, test-data management, defining object repositories, reporting guidelines, and logging strategies. Through hands-on, practical experience, you will go through concepts writing reusable and structure code which is easy to maintain and understand, creating helper classes or utilities, write effective test cases, and generating reports and logs.
